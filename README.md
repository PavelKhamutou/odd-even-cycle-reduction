# The odd-even cycle reduction
Write a short C-language program realizing the odd-even reduction for solving tridiagonal systems of linear equations. Program should make use of calculations distributed on the net of computers. 
Realization in the Open MPI environment. 
Project task from Parallel Numerical Methods.

The "Parallel Scientific Computing in C++ and MPI: A Seamless Approach to Parallel Algorithms and their Implementation" by George Em Karniadakis, Robert M. Kirby II has been used as a source of knowlage.
